# Sudoku Game: A Modern Web Application

**Live Demo:** [Link to Deployed Application (if applicable)]

## üéØ Project Overview

This project is a sophisticated, interactive Sudoku game developed as a demonstration of modern web development capabilities. It showcases a robust frontend built with React and TypeScript, emphasizing clean code, maintainability, and a seamless user experience. The game features dynamic puzzle generation, multiple difficulty levels, real-time input validation, and a suite of user-assistance tools.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Dynamic Sudoku Grid:** Interactive and responsive 9x9 grid.
*   **Client-Side Puzzle Generation:** Ensures unique puzzles are generated efficiently in the browser for various skill levels.
*   **Multiple Difficulty Levels:** Catering to a wide range of users (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert).
*   **Real-time Input Validation:** Instantaneous feedback on cell conflicts (row, column, 3x3 subgrid).
*   **Interactive Timer:** Tracks gameplay duration.
*   **Comprehensive Game Controls:**
    *   **New Game:** Initiate a fresh puzzle.
    *   **Check Solution:** Validate the current board state.
    *   **Hint System:** Reveal a correct number for a selected empty cell.
    *   **Auto-Solve:** Display the complete solution.
*   **Responsive & Modern UI:** Aesthetically pleasing design optimized for various screen sizes using CSS best practices.
*   **State Management:** Efficiently handled using React Hooks for a predictable and performant application state.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Design Rationale

The selection of technologies was driven by the goal of building a high-quality, scalable, and maintainable application:

*   **React (v19+):** Chosen for its component-based architecture, declarative UI, and extensive ecosystem, facilitating the creation of a modular and interactive user interface.
*   **TypeScript:** Integrated to leverage static typing, enhancing code quality, reducing runtime errors, and improving developer experience through better autocompletion and refactoring capabilities.
*   **Vite:** Utilized as the build tool and development server for its blazing-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized build process.
*   **Lodash:** Employed for its utility functions, specifically for array manipulation (`_.shuffle`), deep cloning (`_.cloneDeep`) to ensure immutability in state management, and random number generation (`_.random`) for puzzle generation and hints. These utilities help write more concise and robust logic.
*   **CSS3:** Leveraged for modern styling, including Flexbox/Grid for layout, custom properties (variables) for theming, and media queries for responsiveness.
*   **ESLint:** Configured for code linting to maintain consistent code style and identify potential issues early.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Software Engineering & Development Workflow

This project was developed adhering to industry-standard software engineering practices to ensure robustness and collaboration readiness.

### Version Control & Branching Strategy

*   **Git:** Utilized for version control.
*   **Development Branch (`develop`):** A central `develop` branch served as the primary integration branch for new features.
*   **Feature Branches:** All new features and significant changes were developed in isolated `feature/*` branches (e.g., `feature/ui-enhancement`, `feature/difficulty-levels`). This practice ensures that the `develop` branch (and subsequently `main`) remains stable.
*   **Pull Requests (PRs):** Upon completion, features were merged into the `develop` branch via Pull Requests. This workflow facilitates:
    *   **Code Review:** (Simulated for this project) Allowing for peer review to catch bugs, suggest improvements, and ensure adherence to coding standards.
    *   **Discussion:** A platform for discussing implementation details before merging.
    *   **CI/CD Integration:** (Conceptual) PRs are typical triggers for automated builds, tests, and linting in a CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Main Branch (`main`):** Represents the production-ready code. Merges into `main` would typically come from `develop` after thorough testing and represent stable releases.
*   **Commit Hygiene:** Atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages were used to track changes effectively.

### Code Quality & Best Practices

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is broken down into reusable React components (`Grid`, `Cell`) promoting modularity and separation of concerns.
*   **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`) are used for managing local component state and side effects, ensuring a unidirectional data flow where appropriate.
*   **Modularity:** Business logic for Sudoku generation, validation, and solving is encapsulated within `src/utils/sudokuLogic.ts`, separating it from the UI components.
*   **Error Handling & User Feedback:** The application provides clear status messages for game events, errors, and puzzle completion. Conflicts are visually highlighted.
*   **Immutability:** State updates, particularly for the Sudoku grid, are handled immutably (e.g., using `_.cloneDeep` or spreading techniques) to prevent side effects and ensure predictable state changes.
*   **Readability & Maintainability:** Code is commented where necessary, and TypeScript's static typing contributes significantly to understanding data structures and function signatures.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, please follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
*   npm (v9.x or later recommended) or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grudge17/Sudoku-Coding-Challenge.git # Replace with the actual repository URL
    cd sudoku-coding-challenge
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running Locally

Once dependencies are installed, start the development server:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```
This will launch the Vite development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173`. Open this URL in your web browser.

## üìú Available Scripts

*   `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Starts the development server.
*   `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Creates a production-ready build in the `dist` folder.
*   `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`: Runs ESLint to analyze code for potential issues.
*   `npm run preview` or `yarn preview`: Serves the production build locally for testing.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Potential)

*   **Advanced Uniqueness Check:** Implement a more robust algorithm to ensure generated puzzles have only one unique solution.
*   **Number Palette Input:** Allow users to select numbers from a palette instead of typing.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Full keyboard accessibility for grid navigation and input.
*   **Themes:** Light/Dark mode toggle.
*   **Unit & Integration Tests:** Implement a comprehensive test suite using a framework like Jest and React Testing Library.
